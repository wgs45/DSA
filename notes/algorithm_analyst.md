## Asymptotic Notations

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is a powerful tool used in computer science to describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms. It provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in terms of their worst-case performance. Understanding Big O notation is essential for analyzing and designing efficient algorithms.

### Properties of Big O Notation

Reflexivity, Transitivity, Constant Factor, Sum Rule, Product Rule, Composition Rules.

### Common Big O Notation

- linear Time Complexity Big O(n) complexity
- logarithm Time Complexity Big O(log n) complexity
- Quadratic Time Complexity Big O(n^2) complexity
- Cubic Time Complexity Big O(n^3) complexity
- Polynomial Time Complexity Big O(n^k) complexity
- Exponential Time Complexity Big O(2^n) complexity
- Factorial Time Complexity Big O(n!) complexity
