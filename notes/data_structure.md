# Data Structure Notes

## Classification of Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure

Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

### Static Data Structure

Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
Example: array.

### Dynamic Data Struxture

In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Example: Queue, Stack, etc.

### Non-Linear Data Structure

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples: Trees and Graphs.
